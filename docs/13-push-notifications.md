## Push Notifications in React Native

**1. What are Push Notifications?**

Push notifications are messages sent from a server to a user's device, appearing even when the user isn't actively using the application. They serve as a way to deliver timely, relevant information or re-engage users.

*   **On iOS:** Appear as banners, alerts on the lock screen, and badges on the app icon.
*   **On Android:** Appear in the notification drawer, as heads-up notifications, on the lock screen, and potentially as badges.

**2. Why Use Push Notifications?**

*   **User Engagement:** Bring users back to the app (e.g., new content, promotions, reminders).
*   **Real-time Updates:** Inform users about important events immediately (e.g., new messages, order status changes, alerts).
*   **Transactional Information:** Confirm actions or provide necessary updates (e.g., shipping confirmation, appointment reminders).
*   **Marketing & Promotions:** Announce new features, sales, or events (use sparingly and thoughtfully).

**3. The High-Level Architecture (The Journey of a Push Notification)**

Understanding this flow is essential:

![Diagrammatic Representation](images/Pasted%20image%2020250415183851.png)


1.  **App Registration:** When your React Native app starts, it registers with the device's operating system (iOS or Android) to receive push notifications.
2.  **Token Generation:** The OS communicates with the respective platform's push notification service (APNS for iOS, FCM for Android) and receives a unique **Device Token**. This token acts like an address for sending notifications to *that specific app installation on that specific device*.
3.  **Token Transmission:** Your app receives this Device Token and typically sends it to your backend server.
4.  **Backend Storage:** Your server stores the Device Token, usually associated with a specific user account.
5.  **Sending a Notification:** When an event occurs that should trigger a notification (e.g., a new message for the user), your backend server constructs a **payload** (the notification content: title, body, data) and sends it along with the target user's Device Token(s) to the appropriate platform service (APNS or FCM).
6.  **Platform Delivery:** APNS/FCM validates the request and forwards the notification payload to the target device(s).
7.  **Device Reception:** The device's OS receives the notification.
8.  **App Handling:**
    *   If the app is **killed or in the background**, the OS typically displays the notification directly (banner, lock screen, notification drawer). If the user taps it, the app is launched or brought to the foreground.
    *   If the app is in the **foreground**, the OS usually delivers the notification data directly to the app, allowing you to handle it programmatically (e.g., show an in-app notification, update a badge count).

**4. Key Platform Services:**

*   **APNS (Apple Push Notification Service):** Apple's service for sending notifications to iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS devices. Requires specific certificates and provisioning profiles setup in the Apple Developer portal.
*   **FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging):** Google's cross-platform messaging solution (successor to GCM). Used for sending notifications to Android devices and can also proxy notifications to APNS for iOS devices, simplifying cross-platform backend logic. Requires setup within a Firebase project.

**5. The Crucial Device Token:**

*   Unique per app install per device.
*   Can expire or change (e.g., app reinstall, OS update, user restores from backup).
*   Your app needs logic to:
    *   Request the token on startup/login.
    *   Detect token refreshes.
    *   Send the latest token to your backend.
*   Your backend needs logic to:
    *   Store tokens securely.
    *   Handle token updates/expirations (FCM/APNS provide feedback if a token is invalid).

**6. React Native Implementation Libraries:**

While you *could* interact with native notification APIs directly via custom native modules, it's complex. Libraries abstract this away:

*   **`@react-native-firebase/app` & `@react-native-firebase/messaging` (Recommended):**
    *   Part of the comprehensive RNFirebase suite, providing a JavaScript bridge to the native Firebase SDKs (both Android and iOS).
    *   Leverages FCM for Android and can use FCM to send to APNS on iOS (or interact with APNS directly).
    *   Well-maintained, feature-rich, and aligns with using other Firebase services (Analytics, Firestore, etc.).
    *   **Requires native setup.**
*   **`react-native-push-notification` (Alternative):**
    *   A community-maintained library.
    *   Can work independently of Firebase (though often used with it).
    *   Supports local notifications (scheduled within the app) and remote push notifications.
    *   **Requires native setup.**

**We will focus on `@react-native-firebase/messaging` as it's a very common and robust choice.**

**7. Setup & Usage (`@react-native-firebase/messaging` - Bare RN)**

This involves JavaScript installation AND native configuration. **Follow the official RNFirebase documentation meticulously, as setup steps can change.**

**Prerequisites:**

*   A Firebase project created on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
*   Bare React Native project initialized (`npx react-native init MyApp`).

**Installation:**

```bash
# Install core Firebase app package
npm install @react-native-firebase/app

# Install messaging package
npm install @react-native-firebase/messaging

# Link native dependencies (iOS)
npx pod-install ios
# or: cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

**Native Setup (Highly Summarized - Refer to Official Docs):**

*   **Android:**
    1.  Download `google-services.json` from your Firebase project settings and place it in `android/app/`.
    2.  Add `google-services` plugin classpath to `android/build.gradle`.
    3.  Apply the `google-services` plugin in `android/app/build.gradle`.
    4.  Ensure necessary permissions (like `INTERNET`) are in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
    5.  (Optional but common) Add Firebase service definitions to `AndroidManifest.xml` if needed for custom background handling beyond the library's defaults.
*   **iOS:**
    1.  Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` from Firebase project settings. Open your project in Xcode (`ios/YourApp.xcworkspace`) and add this file (ensure it's added to the main target).
    2.  **Enable Push Notifications Capability:** In Xcode, go to your App Target > Signing & Capabilities > `+ Capability` > Add "Push Notifications".
    3.  **Enable Background Modes Capability:** Add "Background Modes" capability and check "Remote notifications".
    4.  **APNS Configuration:**
        *   In the Apple Developer Portal, create an APNS key or certificate associated with your App ID (ensure Push Notifications are enabled for the App ID).
        *   Upload this key/certificate to your Firebase Project Settings > Cloud Messaging > Apple app configuration.
    5.  **Modify `AppDelegate.m` / `AppDelegate.mm`:**
        *   Import Firebase: `#import <Firebase.h>`
        *   Configure Firebase in `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`: `[FIRApp configure];` (should be near the top).
        *   Register for remote notifications: (Code varies slightly depending on setup, check RNFirebase docs - involves `UNUserNotificationCenter` delegate methods like `application:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:` and `application:didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:`).
        *   Ensure `didReceiveRemoteNotification` methods forward notifications to Firebase if needed.

**Code Implementation (React Native Side):**

```javascript
// index.js or App.js (Setup background handler EARLY)
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';

// Must be registered outside of your component logic, preferably in index.js
messaging().setBackgroundMessageHandler(async remoteMessage => {
  console.log('Message handled in the background!', remoteMessage);
  // --- Handle background data messages here ---
  // You could update AsyncStorage, trigger a local notification, etc.
});


// components/NotificationHandler.js (or inside a main component/hook)
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';
import { Alert, PermissionsAndroid, Platform } from 'react-native';

function NotificationHandler() {

  // --- 1. Request Permissions ---
  const requestUserPermission = async () => {
    if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
      const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission();
      const enabled =
        authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED ||
        authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL;

      if (enabled) {
        console.log('Authorization status:', authStatus);
        // On iOS, getting permission often triggers token registration automatically
        getFcmToken(); // Try getting token after permission grant
      }
    } else if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
      // Android 13+ requires explicit permission
      try {
         await PermissionsAndroid.request(
             PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.POST_NOTIFICATIONS,
         );
         // Older Android versions don't need explicit user permission request via this API
         getFcmToken();
      } catch (err) {
          console.warn('Permission request error:', err);
      }
    }
  };

  // --- 2. Get FCM Token ---
  const getFcmToken = async () => {
    try {
      // Check if registration token already exists
      let currentToken = await messaging().getToken();
      if (currentToken) {
        console.log('FCM Token:', currentToken);
        // **** SEND THIS TOKEN TO YOUR BACKEND SERVER ****
        sendTokenToServer(currentToken);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error getting FCM token:', error);
    }
  };

  // --- Listen for Token Refresh ---
  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = messaging().onTokenRefresh(newToken => {
      console.log('FCM Token Refreshed:', newToken);
      // **** SEND THIS NEW TOKEN TO YOUR BACKEND SERVER ****
      sendTokenToServer(newToken);
    });
    return unsubscribe; // Unsubscribe on cleanup
  }, []);

  // --- Setup Notification Listeners ---
  useEffect(() => {
    requestUserPermission();

    // --- 3. Handle Foreground Messages ---
    // Triggered when a notification is received while the app is in the foreground
    const unsubscribeForeground = messaging().onMessage(async remoteMessage => {
      console.log('Foreground Message Received:', JSON.stringify(remoteMessage));
      Alert.alert(
        remoteMessage.notification?.title || 'Notification',
        remoteMessage.notification?.body || '',
      );
      // You can display a custom in-app notification UI here
    });

    // --- 4. Handle Notification Opens (Background/Killed) ---
    // Triggered when user taps a notification and the app opens from background state
    const unsubscribeOpened = messaging().onNotificationOpenedApp(remoteMessage => {
      console.log(
        'Notification caused app to open from background state:',
        remoteMessage,
      );
      // Navigate based on notification data, e.g.:
      // if (remoteMessage.data?.screen) {
      //   navigation.navigate(remoteMessage.data.screen, remoteMessage.data.params);
      // }
    });

    // --- Check if app was opened from a KILLED state by a notification ---
    messaging()
      .getInitialNotification()
      .then(remoteMessage => {
        if (remoteMessage) {
          console.log(
            'Notification caused app to open from killed state:',
            remoteMessage,
          );
           // Navigate based on notification data
        }
      });

    // Cleanup listeners on component unmount
    return () => {
        unsubscribeForeground();
        unsubscribeOpened();
    };
  }, []); // Run once on mount

  // Dummy function - replace with your actual API call
  const sendTokenToServer = (token) => {
    console.log(`TODO: Send token ${token} to backend`);
    // fetch('/api/save-token', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify({ token }) });
  }

  return null; // This component doesn't render anything visual
}

export default NotificationHandler;

// Then use <NotificationHandler /> somewhere high up in your app tree, e.g., in App.js
```

**8. The Server-Side Role (Briefly)**

*   **Store Tokens:** Securely store device tokens linked to users.
*   **Construct Payload:** Create the notification object. Common fields:
    *   `notification`: `{ title: string, body: string }` (used by FCM/APNS to automatically display a notification when app is in background/killed).
    *   `data`: `{ key: string, value: string, ... }` (custom key-value pairs, always delivered to your app's handlers - `onMessage`, `setBackgroundMessageHandler`, etc.). Used for routing, passing IDs, etc.
    *   Platform-specific options (e.g., `android.channelId`, `apns.headers`, sound, badge count).
*   **Send Request:** Make an authenticated HTTP POST request to the FCM API endpoint (Firebase Admin SDK is recommended) or directly to the APNS API, including the target token(s) and the payload.
*   **Handle Feedback:** Process responses from FCM/APNS to identify and remove invalid/expired tokens from your database.

**9. Testing:**

*   **Real Devices are Essential:** Push notifications often don't work fully (or at all) on iOS simulators. Android emulators generally work better but real devices are always the definitive test.
*   **Firebase Console:** You can send test messages directly from the Firebase Console Cloud Messaging section to specific FCM tokens.
*   **Backend Tools:** Use tools like Postman or write scripts using Admin SDKs to test sending from your backend logic.

**10. Best Practices & Considerations:**

*   **Ask for Permission Wisely:** Don't ask immediately on app launch. Explain *why* you need permission in context before triggering the native prompt.
*   **Provide Value:** Ensure notifications are relevant, timely, and useful. Avoid spamming.
*   **Frequency Capping:** Limit the number of notifications a user receives in a given period.
*   **User Preferences:** Allow users to customize the types of notifications they receive within your app's settings.
*   **Deep Linking:** When a user taps a notification, take them directly to the relevant content within your app, not just the home screen. Use the `data` payload for this.
*   **Token Management:** Implement robust logic for handling token registration, refresh, and removal on both client and server.
*   **Security:** Protect your server keys (FCM Server Key, APNS Auth Key). Never embed them in the client app.
*   **Payload Size Limits:** Be aware of payload size limits (e.g., APNS: 4KB, FCM: 4KB for notification, potentially more for data-only).
